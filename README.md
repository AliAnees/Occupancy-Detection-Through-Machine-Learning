# Occupancy Detection Through Machine Learning
This project aims to detect the occupancy status of an office room through the use of machine learning algorithms. The algorithms analyze patterns in measured enviornmental variables, such as CO2 levels, Light Levels, and Humidity. It then makes a prediction of occupancy status based off these measured values. Three different machine learning algorithms are incorporated: `Naive Bayes`, `Random Forest`, and `Support Vector Machine`. These are accomplished through the use of `Python` and the `scikit-learn` library, as well as `Pandas` for data cleaning and manipulation.
